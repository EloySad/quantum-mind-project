# About <div align="center">
Project Name: Quantum Mind

Category: Our selection encompasses two of the categories; technology and education, a transformative duo.

Motto: ‘Explore, Learn, Innovate: The Technological Universe in Your Hands’.

General Objective: We seek to provide the first approach so that young children and adolescents can immerse themselves in the exciting and stimulating world of technology.

Vision: We want to inspire curiosity and interest in different branches of technology, encouraging creativity and exploration.

Mission: Our mission is to provide educational tools and interactive experiences that allow eager and fertile minds to discover the world of technology. Through games, hands-on content and tutorials. We want to empower students to develop technical skills and be motivated to explore their own ideas and life projects.

Why do we do this?

The technology sector is the driving force behind the development of our societies, playing an increasingly vital role in our daily lives. It is therefore vital that people are trained and build their life projects around this sector, firstly to contribute to this growth and also so that gradually more individuals are adapting to the new working realities that have been boosted even more with the consolidation of new technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence.

We want to be that channel that offers a dynamic and interactive approach to 4 branches of technology that are normally seen as very inaccessible and distant. But which together represent many of the most disruptive changes that we are experiencing today and that we will see consolidate even more in the short and medium term.

Achieving through activities and didactic experiences that the minds eager for knowledge can discover the world of technology. Empowering them to get to know new job options, fields of knowledge and skills, so that they feel motivated to explore their own ideas, dreams and aspirations and finally decide that technological north to complement their life projects. 

What for?

We start from the fact that there are currently no real alternatives that allow enjoyable and interactive approaches to this type of technological topics, we want to give options to people who in one way or another can see their reality transformed, by removing the implicit haze that covers many of the topics in this sector, especially in the 4 branches that we chose as strategic. 

For whom?

Although we profile our target audience in ranges around 14 to 20 years old, Quantum Mind is made for all those people who are interested in the world of technology, either because they like it, because they recognise its value in today's workplace or simply because they want to give themselves the opportunity to approach it and get a glimpse of new areas of knowledge.From children, young people and adults interested in technology. As well as
Students who wish to investigate and broaden their knowledge to professionals who wish to complement their professional careers by focusing on the technology sector.Each and every one of them has the opportunity to have their first contact with Quantum Mind because ‘In technology, every challenge is a door to a world of possibilities; dare to open it and discover the infinite potential of your ingenuity’.


We want to take advantage of the great reach of the internet to bring knowledge wherever it is needed and to be able to sow in young and eager minds the curiosity for technology.

Our target audience are teenagers and young people, to whom we will provide multiple tools to gradually build knowledge and skills that will help them to develop in this world increasingly permeated by technology and of course if someone feels the vocation or the desire to decide on a life project in these fields.

Problem Statement: We live in an increasingly connected world with more and more information, since we are born we have a screen in front of our eyes but this does not necessarily imply that we are taking advantage of this technological boom. 

Scope of the project

short term: Local users, institutions, groups, small groups, small seed groups.
medium term: Individual and national users
long term: Latin American users
outreach: ‘The only limits you have are the limits you believe in’. - Wayne Dyer’.
